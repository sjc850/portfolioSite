          <p>
            When I’m not binging on Schitt’s Creek or The Good Place you can
            most likely find me with a pizza in my mouth or up in the mountains.
            (Sometimes both)<br />
            I like taking long road trips if not only to help me get through the
            hours and hours of backlogged podcasts in my queue.<br />
            My highest achievement so far in life is probably when I ran into
            Matt Damon in an elevator at The Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho. After
            we shook hands he said, ‘Whoa, nice handshake’.

          <h3>Always Learning</h3>
          <p>
            My belief is that no one is truly a master of anything. There’s
            always room to from, more things to learn and facilitating details
            in the ordinary. Because of this type of belief system I get to
            learn new things everyday (which you would think would be helpful
            for pub trivia on Wednesdays) and gain experience in areas that
            offer growth on different levels.

          <h3>Humans === Computers</h3>
          <p>
            Way back before the Myspace days of hacking into html to make your
            page look fresh af, I was always interested in the interactions with
            technology. Not being smart enough to create anything and not having
            an artistic skill in design left me somewhere in the middle between
            of all things ‘interwebby’. Funnily enough, that’s the position most
            of us find ourselves in everyday which launched me into a world of
            support (just restart your computer, mom) and user experience.

          <h3>Pizza Preferences</h3>
          <p>
            What makes a good pizza? Is it the crust? The toppings? The wood
            used to cook it? <br />All good questions, but each in itself leaves
            out the most important part of eating pizza. Pizza is all about the
            experience. When in Chicago, you go deep dish. When in New York, you
            go big and wide (looking at you Grimaldi’s) When you’re at a pub,
            you go small and flakey. As long as where you are, you’re having a
            pie that represents the moment, sharing it with good people and
            making it more of an experience than a meal…that’s the best pizza.
